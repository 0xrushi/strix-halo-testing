These are test scripts for testing flash attention.

Can start with existing dockerfile:
- https://github.com/scottt/rocm-TheRock/tree/gfx1151/dockerfiles/pytorch-dev

Build AOTriton:
https://llm-tracker.info/_TOORG/Strix-Halo#aotriton 

- This is straightforward, just takes a while

Build PyTorch:
https://llm-tracker.info/_TOORG/Strix-Halo#pytorch

- This is a huge PITA, maybe there are easier ways to do it if you avoid the ci script
